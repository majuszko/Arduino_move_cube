# Arduino_move_cube
Test of Arduino and Unity using Ardity.

The main idea of this experiment was to check how would Arduino work as a device to move a cube in the Unity scene.

Used components:
- Arduino Nano
- Ultrasound sensor

The ultrasound sensor was used to measure the distance to the nearest obstacle and depending on the measurement, the cube moved faster or slower (when the distance was smaller, the cube moved 
slower, and it moved faster when the distance was bigger).
